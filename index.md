## About Me
I'm a Deep Learning Research Engineer at [Enlitic](https://www.enlitic.com),
where I work with a cross-functional team to apply Natural Language
 Processing (NLP) to the field of radiology. I'm passionate about 
  how we can train deep learning models to understand the complexities of
   language, with a budding interest in Computer Vision and
    multimodal applications combining NLP and CV.
   
In 2019, I received an M.S. in Language Technologies at
 the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at
  [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Advised by Alex
   Hauptmann, my research focused on the application of DL NLP in the 
    extraction of useful tweets during public safety events.
    
Prior to my time at CMU, I obtained a "diplôme d'ingénieur" at the [Ecole
 Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en)
 in Paris, France. This diploma combined a B.S-equivalent undergraduate degree
  with a Masters in Data Science. While at Ecole Polytechnique, I
   worked with the teams at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/) in
    Menlo Park and [Pzartech](https://www.pzartech.com/), an Israeli start
    -up based in Tel-Aviv.
