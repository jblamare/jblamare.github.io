## About Me
I'm an AI Scientist at [Covera Health](https://www.coverahealth.com/){:target="_blank"}, 
where I work with a cross-functional team to apply Deep Learning and Natural Language
 Processing (NLP) to the field of radiology. I'm passionate about 
  how we can train deep learning models to understand the complexities of
   language.

Previously, I was a Senior Research Scientist in Deep Learning and NLP at 
[Enlitic](https://www.enlitic.com){:target="_blank"} from 2019 to 2021. A description of 
my different contributions can be found on my resume.
   
In 2019, I received an M.S. in Language Technologies at
 the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at
  [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Advised by Alex
   Hauptmann, my research focused on the application of DL NLP in the 
    extraction of useful tweets during public safety events.
    
Prior to my time at CMU, I obtained a "diplôme d'ingénieur" at the [Ecole
 Polytechnique (X)](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en){:target="_blank"}
 in Palaiseau, France. This diploma combined a B.S-equivalent undergraduate degree
  with a Masters in Data Science. While at Ecole Polytechnique, I
   worked with the teams at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/){:target="_blank"} in
    Menlo Park and [Pzartech](https://www.pzartech.com/){:target="_blank"}, an Israeli start-up based in Tel-Aviv.
    
When I'm not working, I like to [learn languages](https://www.duolingo.com
/profile/Jibelam){:target="_blank"}, play [tennis](https://m.tennislink.usta.com/statsandstandings/StatsAndStandings.aspx?t=8&par1=DB00923927D0A18695940B4A09684FAE3D&par2=2019&par3=0){:target="_blank"}, 
music, [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/jlamare){:target="_blank
"}, travel, bake, and wait for the ski season to start!
